(keep in mind, how to improve my phone dev experience, maybe make app do ajax for JSON) (0-2)

Total: 8-11 hours...full day or two!

then:
- merge css for app in ember and outside ember
- (keep in mind, how to improve my phone dev experience, maybe make app do ajax for JSON)
- proper nice page change/transition on mobile without quirks with good performance (just swipe or something probably fine)
- 3d page flip stuff (just flat pages or maybe try straight for page mesh that is flexible)
- control start/stop of narration/pause
- menu/page chooser on app

me:
no more tables
make slider go 0% to 100% and show %!
split camera/scene properly in node and in tool ui
deprecate legacy attributes

dynamic functions:
try fit in animation/orientation?
camera?
relative to somevalue(maybe should generalize this more)
interaction ^_^?

think, do we ever want absolute size or just relative? consider differnt screen sizes
same with ummm...camera position? or app position? should be relative to screen size not abs

bug: add many new popups all have same name - new. name is supposed to be unique identifier lol
bug: remove popup doesnt redraw...should check all things if they redraw insta. seems like change rotate type doesnt either.
bug: changing names of popup doesnt affect the select until refresh
bug: selects/radios
