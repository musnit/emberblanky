josh:
- cordova build still working? (1)
- voice loop bug (1.5)
- fix desk zoom (camera depth vs camera perspective?) (1.5)
- tweak squashed desk version (0.5)
- portrait hands version (0.5)
- tweak hand accelo strength/motion on phone! (1)
- get pirate narration running on phone (1-2)
- get demo on phone of all these pages (street, 2xdesk, 2xhands, ship) (1)
(keep in mind, how to improve my phone dev experience, maybe make app do ajax for JSON) (0-2)

Total: 8-11 hours...full day or two!

then:
- (keep in mind, how to improve my phone dev experience, maybe make app do ajax for JSON)
- proper nice page change/transition on mobile without quircks with good performance (just swipe or something probably fine)
- 3d page flip stuff (just flat pages or maybe try straight for page mesh that is flexible)

me:
no more tables
make slider go 0% to 100% and show %!
split camera/scene properly in node and in tool ui

dynamic functions:
try fit in animation/orientation?
camera?
relative to somevalue(maybe should generalize this more)
interaction ^_^?

think, do we ever want absolute size or just relative? consider differnt screen sizes
same with ummm...camera position? or app position? should be relative to screen size not abs

bug: add many new popups all have same name - new. name is supposed to be unique identifier lol
bug: remove popup doesnt redraw...should check all things if they redraw insta. seems like change rotate type doesnt either.
bug: changing names of popup doesnt affect the select until refresh
bug: selects/radios
